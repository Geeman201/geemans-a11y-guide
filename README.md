Approximately 20% of the UK population have a disability. That's 1 in every 5 people that might be unable to use your website or application. The web is often 'just another place' where this minority are forgotten so the aim of this guide is to enable Software Engineers to produce better code to offer a better experience for those who require assistive technologies.

### Is this for me?
If you write frontend code I'd recommend you continue reading. It contains a raft of resources, information and coded examples of best practices and great semantics. It's unique due to the addition of audio samples of assistive tools interpretting the coded examples.

Throughout a basic level of competency in HTML, CSS & Javascript is assumed.

## How should I use this?
You can use this as:

* A reference guide
* A training tool
* In conjunction with a a11y tools
* A bookmark
* A talking point with colleagues

The main beneficiaries will be users who have spent long enough trying to browse your site.

## Setup
The following npm/yarn commands are available:
`yarn start` - Starts a live reloading development server
`yarn build` - Builds the guide into a flat HTML/JS/CSS structure
