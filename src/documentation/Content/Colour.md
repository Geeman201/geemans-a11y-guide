## Colour
This forms your brand and often distinguishes 'good' sites from 'great' sites. From an accessibility perspective there are two main 
considerations:
* **Contrast** - Users with sight difficulties may not be able to read your content if the contrast between the background colour and 
text colour is to low. 
* **Colour blindness** - Some colours are 'invisible' to some and will appear as a shade of grey instead.

### Essentials
* Use a colour contrast checker to ensure an appropriate contrast level for your text/background
* Use textures to help colour blind users identify differences when using colour.
* Don't rely on colour to convey meaning. Be explicit and use labels/tooltips. For example A 'Traffic Light' status bar could also have 
'Good','Ok', 'Bad' to supplement the colours
* Some users use custom stylesheets to override all colours
