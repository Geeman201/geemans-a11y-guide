## Content
The most important aspect of any website! 

### Essentials
* Ensure your structure is well thought out and logical without CSS
* Try not to differ on the general structure of your page. It means users have to relearn where everything is. Just 
like writing code, consistency is key! 
* Make sure you have a consistent 'brand' and 'personality' across your pages
